                <p>I moved to the Verde Valley almost two years ago, and quickly discovered I was pregnant with my daughter. It was during my own pregnancy journey that I found a passion and direction for my life-design and birth work!</p>
                <p>I am currently on my way to earning an AA in Graphic Design at Yavapai College to help support my endevours in the small business world. Iâ€™ve always had a passion for design and art, and finally found a way to combine my skills with a direction I am passionate about.</p>
